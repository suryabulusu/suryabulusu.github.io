      Waz and Bruno define self-surveillance as the attention one pays to one’s
      behavior when facing the actuality or virtuality of an immediate or
      mediated observation by others whose opinion he or she deems relevant -
      usually, the observers of the same or superior social position
      <d-cite key="vaz2003types"></d-cite>. For example, we may control
      ourselves from sharing certain posts on Facebook fearing that our friends
      might not like it. Sometimes, we scroll back through our timeline and
      delete any embarrassing posts that we’ve made in the past before someone
      else finds it and trolls us. It can be seen as censoring oneself or
      controlling oneself. You may control yourself from consuming harmful
      substances because you know they’re unhealthy.

      Self-surveillance is very important for celebrities who are active on
      social media. If a celebrity makes a statement, she must ensure that she
      has not made even a slight negation of that statement in the past. Else,
      she’d be charged with hypocrisy and get trolled. Media outlets today have
      people dedicated to scrolling through a celeb’s tweets. Once a
      <em>malicious</em> tweet is found, an entire article is written on it
      <em>exposing</em> the celeb. The article is carefully framed to attract
      readers and gain virality. The readers usually don’t see how old the
      <em>malicious</em> tweet is and assume that it is a recent one.
    </p>

    <p>
      To illustrate, let us consider the case of stand-up comedian Kunal Kamra.
      Kamra is known for his anti-authoritarian humor and has been attracting a
      lot of hate from right-wing activists. Recently, his haters furiously
      retweeted old tweets wherein he made dark jokes on Muslims. Not only was
      he criticized by his followers for being offensive, but also lost a lot of
      them. To avoid further damage, he was forced to deactivate his Twitter
      account. After the backlash subsided, he reactivated his account offering
      an explanation. He claimed they were very old tweets he made before
      gaining popularity, and his thoughts have matured over the years

      How would a celeb avoid such situations? She can have control over what
      she says in the present, but what about the past? This is where
      self-surveillance comes in. Celebs have hired PR teams to take care of
      their accounts. PR teams conduct regular checks of the account and see to
      it that there are no trailing malicious tweets. However, if such tweet is
      found by trolls before the PR team does, deleting it would be of no help
      as screenshots are taken. You could delete the tweet and claim that the
      screenshot is doctored, but that might not help either, because of Wayback
      Machine - which could be storing your tweets.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wayback Machine, in layman terms, is a storehouse of web pages. It sends
      out bots to crawl across the Web and take snapshots of whatever they see.
      Suppose you made a malicious blog post 10 years back and shared the link
      on Facebook. No one has read it then as you weren’t popular. Now you are a
      celeb, and realize that you made a stupid blog post years ago, so you
      delete it. When I grab hold of the link you shared via FB and click on it,
      I’d not find any content as you deleted the post. However, if I search for
      the same link on Wayback Machine, I’d find your content as at some point
      of time a crawler would’ve taken a snapshot of your page. I could use this
      to <em>expose</em> you. Methods of exposing using this technology are
      being explored nowadays in Indian media. Web pages use a
      <span style="font-family: Courier">robots.txt</span> file to avoid being
      crawled upon.
