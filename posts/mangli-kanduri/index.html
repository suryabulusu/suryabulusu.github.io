      Having mostly written technical essays before, this prose is a departure
      for me. So, expect some rough edges. More than anything, I hope to express
      my gratitude to the prodigious documenters of the city. If I can augment
      their work in any way, it would be a great joy. I’ve included references
      and footnotes wherever possible. All photographs here are mine, and where
      I’ve used images from elsewhere, I’ve cited them. Street photography is
      challenging; capturing moments without intruding is something I’m still
      learning. I’ve struggled with the presentation of images here, but I trust
      it comes together.

      While Mumbai’s traditionally famous attractions, from Churchgate’s
      colonial grandeur to Bandstand’s seafront charm, undeniably captivate, I’m
      more drawn to its underappreciated central neighbourhoods: Grant Road,
      Byculla, Sion, Dharavi. The absence of tourist crowds allows for a more
      intimate understanding of working class life and the city’s rhythms. To
      me, it’s enchanting to be lost in the liminal gullies, observing how
      diverse communities build resilience through shared spaces.

        I’ve never really had a productive answer when people ask me about my
        interest in walking. But I’ll give it a shot now: walking is liberating,
        not just as a movement but as a way of seeing. It is the freedom to
        define your own dignified ruleset, to cultivate a taste for exploration,
        to lose yourself in the city’s unnoticed corners, to step into the
        conventionally unremarkable and find something worth lingering over. And
        maybe that fits, because I’m unremarkable too. Is it for everyone? No.
        It takes abundant time, patience, and either reliable bowel control or
        an acceptance of SBM toilets. I won’t summon the spirits of Mumbai, no
        grand exorcisms. I understand why many don’t see the appeal. Maybe
        further exaggeration, poetry, and surrealism can bring clarity. The
        expansiveness I feel as I loiter demands a matching expansiveness of
        language. For now, I’m limited by my lack of finesse. All I can do is
        try my best through a confluence of text and images.

      One of my pastimes is zooming into Google Maps and hunting for curious
      spots in these neighbourhoods. Exploring Nagpada this way, I spotted the
      Mangli Kanduri Masjid and chawl, the name instantly catching my attention.

      <p>
        The first word, Mangli, reminded me of the folk singer I deeply admire,
        known for her spirited Telangana songs. She lends her fiery, tempestuous
        voice to popular Telugu film tracks, amassing millions of YouTube views.
        Her infectious personality shines brightest in interviews -- I’m
        particularly fond of the
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFdQ7LLHhyU&t=896s">one</a>
        with five-time CPI(ML)ND MLA Gummadi Narsaiah.
      </p>
      <p>
        The second word, Kanduri, a surname I’m not personally familiar with,
        yet it rang a distant bell. I’ve encountered similar names like
        “Kandukuri” or “Konduri” before. I
        <a

          >looked</a

        up Padmashali caste surnames and discovered that Kanduri is indeed one
        of them. To be sure, the list hardly seemed reliable: almost every
        surname I knew was crammed into it!

      How fascinating, I thought, to find a Masjid named after what seemed to be
      a Telugu woman. Predictably, my online searches yielded little beyond
      maintenance complaints about the chawl. Yet this place sits in quite a
      prime spot, along the historic Foras Road (now RS Nimkar Marg), next to
      the

      in 2023. I went with a friend, maybe drawn in by the intrigue and
      notoriety surrounding the place. But the walk offered much more. I learned
      about the area’s politics, its textile market and business networks, and
      architecture. What struck me most was an arch that read Telugu Munurwar
      Wadi, standing right across from a Pochamma Temple.

      Over the next several months, I read up intermittently on the Telugu
      influence in the area. Many migrants from the Nizam’s territories --
      Nizamabad, Adilabad, Nanded, parts of Andhra -- came to Mumbai for work
      and settled here.
      <a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/766966230532853/">Padmashali</a>
      weavers found work in textile mills, while the Munurwar Kapu castes
      involved in construction activities became big contractors. Some of
      Mumbai’s finest buildings were built under the supervision of Telugu
      contractors. Some examples: Jaya Karadi Lingu (contractor for Watson
      Hotel, Sassoon Building), Vyanku Balu Kalewar (BMC), Raosaheb Naagu Sayaji
      (Secretariat, Bombay High Court), Wadnala Saibu (Nesbit Bridge, Hancock
      Bridge), Shankarrao Puppala (Plumbing for CST).

      I wanted to look beyond construction and explore their broader influence
      on the city, particularly in the freedom movement and politics. Much of
      what I learned came from a Google
      <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/mtmgroup2/about">Group</a> run by Mr.
      Jagan Babu Ganji and scattered scans from a Marathi book “Mumbaicha
      Ubharneeth: Telugu Samajache Yogdaan” by Manohar Kadam (which I couldn’t
      find online). Indeed, the community’s Sayaji Laxman
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S._L._Silam">Silam</a> contributed
      to the Quit India movement and later became the speaker of the first
      assembly of Maharashtra Vidhan Sabha in 1960. Some members also had a

      in the Satyashodhak Samaj, working toward social upliftment. Several
      Telugu corporators, like Parshuram Puppala, held key positions in the BMC
      back when it was one of the most respected institutions in the city.

        was their State President back in 2010. Vijay Wadettiwar, also with
        Telugu origins, is a leader of opposition from the Congress Party in
        Maharashtra Vidhan Sabha. I’ve noticed that those with “-war” in
        surnames generally have Telugu origins (corresponding to “vaaru” in
        Telugu). A Google search revealed they are mostly Deshashta Brahmins
        from the Deccan. For instance, KB Hedgewar, founder of the RSS, also has
        Telugu origins. Though I’m not fully convinced by this theory as Vijay
        Wadettiwar is an OBC leader.</d-footnote

      Jagan Babu’s group focuses on strengthening Telugu-Marathi ties and

      explore this in more detail later.

      Understandably, many in the Telugu community are concerned about how
      Kamathipura is perceived. The name itself evokes images of crime,
      brothels, and vice -- an association they have long struggled against.
      Some even push for renaming the area

      in an attempt to distance it from that reputation and attract
      redevelopment. Kamathipura is immensely diverse, shaped by forces far
      beyond just its red-light district. Instead of offering my own summary,
      I’ll defer to those who have documented their lived experiences here,
      which I reference in the footnotes.

        (2022) takes liberties with locations, setting much of its story in Pila
        House (Pathe Bapurao Marg) near New Roshan Talkies (now lost to
        redevelopment), far from the heart of Kamathipura. A Hotstar web series
        in 2022 titled
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wzzt5yaaGH4">Kamathipura</a>
        (later renamed to The Tattoo Murders) uses the name but does little to
        capture its milieu, reducing the area to its red-light district. However
        some accounts do stand out. Daya Pawar’s autobiography
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baluta_(autobiography">Baluta</a>
        (1978) evocatively portrays the joys and struggles of Mahar Dalits in

        >
        (1986) brings an unsettling, almost repulsive poetry to the area.
        Kamathipura has long attracted beat journalists, artists, and NGOs. Some
        approach it with genuine intentions (me, hopefully), while others are
        more exploitative, each attempting in their own way to frame its
        story.</d-footnote

      I’ve always been drawn to stories of migration, but I feel a particular
      pull toward Telugus. Maybe it’s the familiarity of the language that makes
      me feel I can uncover something others might overlook. Or maybe it’s
      because their influence beyond business or labour is not celebrated
      enough, perhaps due to a lack of self-interest. Where are the figures of
      revolt, creativity, intellectual or technical excellence? Why hasn’t there
      been a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nayakan">Nayakan</a> about a
      Telugu figure? If Dharavi had
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varadarajan_Mudaliar">Mudaliar</a>,
      why not a Telugu don in Kamathipura?
    </p>

      That’s why I find myself seeking out Telugus in unexpected places -- like
      <a
        href="https://indianliberals.in/content/c-y-chintamani-the-liberal-editor-politician/"
        >CY Chintamani</a
      >, a liberal thinker from Vizianagaram who edited an English newspaper in
      Allahabad in the 1920s, critiquing both the British Raj and Congress
      leaders. Or
      <a
        href="https://www.wisdomlib.org/history/compilation/triveni-journal/d/doc68589.html"
        >K Punniah</a
      >, born in Chirala, who settled in Karachi and ran the Sindh Observer,
      openly challenging Jinnah in the 1940s. These aren’t the typical stories
      of migration we hear. Today, Telugu identity is often tied to NRI success
      stories (CEOs in Silicon Valley), but I’m more interested in those who
      shaped history here. Even if I don’t find anything extraordinary, the
      search itself is worthwhile. At the very least, it gives me new ways to
      think about identity.
    </p>

      I was so thrilled to come across K Punniah in Steve Inskeep’s excellent
      book “Instant City: Life and Death in Karachi” (2011).

      Back to Mangli Kanduri: admittedly, the Telugu woman theory might seem
      biased and presumptuous, but consider the broader context. Kamathipura
      lies just nearby and Telugu influence in these neighbourhoods runs deep.

      Balaram, whose namesake road stands near Grant Road railway station,
      slightly far from here. Also, towards one end of Foras Road, there’s a TB
      clinic which he funded during the plague crisis of the late 1800s.
      Moreover, even if Mangli Kanduri wasn’t herself prominent, the chawl might
      have been named by a Telugu contractor after his kin. Such gestures have
      precedent, like the Gaurabai Dispensary in Kamathipura, named after
      Balaram’s wife.

    <p>
      But I didn’t want to get too caught up in the Telugu woman theory. Another
      path opened up when I searched further: Kanduri, it turns out, is a famous
      mutton preparation in Marathwada. The region’s deep connections to the
      Deccan and Nizam’s rule are reflected in its distinct culinary masalas
      like Saoji and Kanduri. The word “Kanduri” itself traces back to feasts
      (nivad, naivedyam) at dargahs of the region, which also function as sites
      of cultural syncretism. Megha Kale vividly describes her
      <a
        href="https://ruralindiaonline.org/article/whose-shrine-is-it-anyway%20"
        >experience</a
      >
      at a dargah in Osmanabad district, where Muslims and Hindus together climb
      a gad (hill) for the Kanduri feast. After prayers, the men exclusively
      handle the goat-cutting and meat-cooking, while women prepare the masala
      and bhakri (bread). Intriguingly, there’s also a place called Mangli near
      Nagpur. Could Muslims from that region have made their way here to Foras
      Road, and named their settlement in commemoration of a feast they’ve once
      organized? The presence of the masjid and the predominantly Muslim
      residents of the chawl lend some possibility to this theory, however
      tentative.
      <d-footnote
        >Kanduri's etymological roots remain elusive, though its cultural
        resonance spans widely. A similar
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIY-Fz8kvnk">festival</a> in
        Nagapattinam draws Hindu devotees, suggesting a broader pattern of
        inclusive religious gatherings. The term also appears in the
        <a
          href="https://www.muslimsocieties.org/dargah-of-syed-salar-masud-ghazi-a-sacred-space-for-all-faiths-2/"
          >practices</a
        >
        of Bahraich’s Ghazi Miyan Dargah, where a ceremonial Kanduri
        <a
          href="https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O475616/kanduri-shrine-cloth-unknown/"
          >cloth</a
        >
        adorns the tomb of Ghazi Sayyid Salar Masud. I was pleasantly surprised
        to find these connections. These recurring instances of syncretism
        across regions -- from Tamil Nadu to Bahraich -- reveal how deeply
        interfaith harmony is woven into our fabric.</d-footnote
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      Discovering syncretic traditions through a single word offered me a fresh
      lens to view our intertwined histories. In a time when media narratives
      fixate on Hindu-Muslim tensions, amplified by our conservative ruling
      party, embracing this theory felt important. Some argue that respectful
      economic transactions at arm’s length are sufficient for co-existence. But
      I disagree! To reduce our bonds to mere trade is impoverishing and
      overlooks centuries of shared spiritual and emotional lives. This harmony
      isn’t performative; it’s simply a part of everyday life. Perhaps its very
      ordinariness made us complacent, leaving space for divisive narratives.
    </p>
    <h3 id="testing-the-theories">Testing The Theories</h3>
    <p>
      Now comes the work of testing these theories. It’s far harder than it
      sounds. Really, it’s a grind -- reaching out, following leads, hitting
      walls. Inquiries go unanswered. Online, we see several accounts of
      generous informants eagerly sharing details, creating a deceptive
      impression that stories flow freely. The reality is thornier. There’s
      politics at play, telling silences, careful boundaries. Memories get
      reshaped over time, sometimes unconsciously, as communities make sense of
      their past. What follows is a glimpse into this process. The outcome might
      seem underwhelming, but that’s precisely why it matters.
    </p>
    <p>
      To start with, here's a brief note on my trail: I stay in Kalina. The
      route I take to the chawl goes through Kurla, where I catch a fast local
      to Byculla, then walk through Mominpura and Madanpura. These are vibrant
      neighbourhoods with deep political roots -- from the Awami Idara, Mumbai’s
      oldest Urdu
      <a
        href="https://www.himalmag.com/culture/awami-indara-muslim-left-legacy-urdu-library-mumbai-2023"
        >library</a
      >
      (now nearly lost to redevelopment), to recent NRC protests, and the
      historic struggles of Muslim mill workers.
      <d-footnote
        >I’ve tried alternate routes. Catch a slow local from Santacruz to
        Mumbai Central and walk through the leather market in Madanpura. It’s
        equally fun, but the Kurla to Byculla route is both quicker and
        thematically more relevant. Plus, the latter takes you through a
        Bhatiyaar Galli featuring enterprising street caterers.</d-footnote

    <p>
      Next, how do I even begin asking the people at the chawl? A big part of my
      hesitation came from having nothing to offer in return. What could I
      possibly say? Why should any of this matter to us? I’m not an
      ethnographer, a historian, or a journalist. I can’t improve their living
      conditions, highlight their struggles, or advocate for them in any
      meaningful way. I’m not even a walk host, framing this as part of some
      curated experience. At the end of the day, this is for my own hedonistic
      pursuit of knowledge, mining stories, and blogging. But stating that
      outright felt too inadequate.
    </p>
    <p>
      On my first visit, I couldn’t summon the courage to approach the older
      residents, so I asked some kids instead, but they didn’t know much. I went
      again, this time with a pretext: something like researching the names of
      dargahs in Mumbai. To be fair, it’s a genuinely interesting thread to pull
      at. Haji Ali is famous, but what about the lesser-known ones? Near my
      house, there’s a Bengali Baba Dargah. In Antop Hill, one named after an
      <a
        href="https://www.mid-day.com/news/opinion/article/Meher-Marfatia--Tiger-eyes-and-timeless-tombs-18655175"
        >Egyptian</a
      >
      saint. Right next to CST,
      <a
        href="https://www.mid-day.com/mumbai/mumbai-news/article/pedro-shah-the-saint-of-cst-who-made-baskets-fly-18710168"
        >Pedro</a
      >
      Shah Dargah. Each has a fascinating tale behind it.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, using this as an entry point, I asked a chacha selling kids’ toys: How
      did this masjid get its name? He looked at me, unimpressed. Then, with a
      sharp edge to his voice, he shot back: “Why do you care? First, tell me
      your name. What’s the origin of that? Does it change anything? Mai idhar
      paida hua tha aur iss naam ka koi matlab nahi.” The kids around us
      laughed, but he wasn’t joking. I tried reasoning with him, but before I
      could get anywhere, a woman nearby tugged me away. Not forcefully, but
      firmly, like she had seen this play out before.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think I understood his concern. This place is always under the radar of
      real estate developers. In fact, I had entered the chawl through an
      unusual route, cutting through the masjid, in the shadow of Orchid Enclave
      complex (see <a href="#map-layout">Figure 4</a>). A narrow lane runs
      straight through the complex, leading from its gates to the masjid, and
      then further into the chawl. It felt strange. Apartment complexes rarely
      sit alongside older settlements; usually, they consume them. Redevelopment
      always begins with questions of origins, documentation, proof of
      belonging. Maybe, for a second, chacha thought I was one of those people.
    </p>
    <p>
      Or, maybe, he was worried about the NRC? I can’t say for sure, and I’d be
      wrong to assume. But what was clear was their discomfort with my questions
      about origins.
    </p>
    <p>
      I approached another older man, who seemed to have more authority in the
      area. He told me he was born here, that the masjid had been around for
      more than a hundred years, and that this was an all-Muslim neighborhood.
      “Telugus live far away,” he said. I felt too awkward to bring up the
      Kanduri feast theory, but I tried anyway. He dismissed it outright. “It’s
      not worth it,” he said. “No one knows.”
    </p>
    <p>
      I found it sad that part of their self-discovery was overshadowed by fear.
      What if knowing more about origins unearthed something uncomfortable about
      their past? Could that, in some way, threaten their present livelihood?
      Again, this is all my assumption, but it lingered in my mind as I left,
      thanking them for their time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maybe the Telugu folks on the other side of Foras Road would care more
      about Mangli Kanduri? My plan was to visit the Munurwar Wadi office,
      hoping to find someone with answers. As I entered the lanes of
      Kamathipura, I noticed some event preparation at VR Tulla playground and
      decided to walk in. In one corner, I spotted a group of young men --
      probably in their mid-to-late twenties -- gathered outside a small office.
      It turned out to be the Vittal Sayanna Telugu Gymkhana, a place I hadn’t
      known even existed. Stumbling upon it felt like a stroke of luck. I
      approached them, and to my relief, they were welcoming.
    </p>
    <p>
      A mistake I made, which I only realized later, was sticking to the same
      pretext I had used at the chawl -- that I was tracing the names of
      masjids. This annoyed them. “We don't know either, but why do you care?
      Who asked you to study this? Why is this even a question? Adi Mangli
      Masjid kaadu. Adi Temple.” They were clearly conservative. One even
      mentioned he led the local Jai Shri Ram group. I explained that my real
      interest was in tracing a Telugu connection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slowly, the conversation shifted. They spoke with pride about their area,
      pointing out well-known figures like Parshuram Puppala. They showed me
      their gym, filled with old, worn-out gear. “Ambedkar was here”, they said.
      “Johnny Lever too.” Honestly, I didn’t need them to emphasize the area’s
      importance. I was already convinced of its broader relevance. But I was
      glad they wanted to share.

    <p>
      “This place is not that bad, bro”, one of them said, exhaling a trail of
      smoke as he passed me his beedi. Then, almost as if catching himself, he
      grinned and added, “Beedi is okay, bro. A little beer too. But not the
      brothel.” The contrast was funny: vice, but within limits. I didn’t argue.
      Their concerns had their own logic. This place indeed bears the weight of
      deep-seated taboos.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had no trouble blending with Marathis. “I understand Telugu”, one
      told me, “but speak to me in Hindi, please.” They squarely blamed Muslims
      for the taboos associated with the area. “Not all are bad”, one of them
      conceded. “We respect their practices. But it’s not our concern. Maa
      gurinchi adgu mem cheptam. Ask anything about our Pochamma Temple. Attend
      our Shivratri, our Bonalu. We’ll show you real fun -- <i>safely</i>.”
      Before I left, they shared their numbers, promising me to think about the
      chawl.
    </p>
    <p>
      I then went to Munurwar Wadi, where I met a videographer who shoots local
      events. He suggested I ask the politicians. He had filmed in the chawl
      before but never really paid attention to its name. Still, he patiently
      listened to my theories. Then he asked, “Are you from YouTube?” “I intend
      to write”, I said. He smirked. “No one reads anymore.” Dear reader, you’re
      proving him wrong!
    </p>
    <p>
      I couldn’t explore further and headed home before the local trains got too
      crowded. I felt deflated because no one seemed to desire a shared story --
      a wiser, more progressive telling of the past. It felt like there was
      little hope for such a narrative to emerge. Spaces shaped by migration
      should naturally be sites of progress and fluid identities. Instead, they
      have receded into constrictive readings of history.
    </p>
    <p>
      Take the Telugu-Marathi book I mentioned earlier (<a
        href="#telugu-samajache-yogdaan"

      gatherings: a baba delivering

      >
      of Bangladeshi Hindus. To be clear, these are not inherently bad. It’s
      heartening to see a sense of togetherness and a thriving communal life.
      But why is this the only form of collectivity left? Why is there no
      interest in engaging with the history of Muslims who migrated alongside
      Telugus back in the day?

      A diverse history is what makes us unique. But today, looking back comes
      with tension. One community fears that digging too deep into the past
      might put their identity at risk. The other searches history only to claim
      ownership over land. A more generous, open-ended exploration that fosters
      understanding rather than division seems to be of little interest, at
      least among those I met.
    </p>
    <p>
      This, I believe, is partly a consequence of progressive academics and
      civil society groups withdrawing from these neighbourhoods. These are
      sites of transformative potential, yet engagement remains confined to
      abstractions like textbooks or conferences. Or perhaps, we simply lack the
      funding. The BJP and its cultural organizations have both the money and
      the political will to shape the narrative.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is not to say that the people here are entirely conservative. Most
      still vote for Congress. Amin Patel remains a popular figure. When Telugu
      star Chiranjeevi was with Congress, he
      <a

        >frequented</a
      >
      this area too. I don’t particularly care what political affiliations they
      choose, and if entering conservative power circles is a means of lobbying
      for their community, then so be it. What troubles me is the steady retreat
      of progressive values.

      generosity. I, too, have witnessed this togetherness, especially among
      women, which I’ll address later on.

      One of the functions of heritage walks should be to cultivate a shared
      sense of belonging and remind people of the wonders of co-existence. This
      doesn’t mean the past was free of conflicts, but there were largely
      moments of kindness. Heritage groups should work to ensure that the
      dominant voices in the streets and the media do not advocate for
      anti-secular values.
    </p>
    <p>
      To reiterate, I don’t look down on caste or religious groups. If anything,
      they’ve managed to preserve valuable memories that few progressive circles
      seem interested in. But at some point, shouldn’t these identities be
      examined and interpreted in a way that brings a more inclusive
      understanding? Ideally, scholars should take on that role. Yet, they seem
      to have stepped away, leaving the space entirely to insular forces.
    </p>
    <p>
      Imagine this future. If no one cares, the chawl will disappear. The
      gymkhana, gone. The Pochamma Temple, gone. All of it reduced to footnotes
      in text books, as fragments in memory, with no breathing physical space to
      anchor it. And with it, a potential path to inclusivity will be lost
      forever.

      Throughout the essay, I’ve not addressed the challenges of women in
      Kamathipura. The omission wasn’t accidental but borne from careful
      consideration. Walking through the lanes presents a visible normalcy, and
      I’m not equipped to excavate the deeper complexities. Approaching their
      specific circumstances demanded a sensitivity I feared I might lack.
      Rather than risk clumsy intrusions that would diminish their lived
      experiences, I’ve chosen to reference relevant documentaries and scholarly

      Instead, let me share a couple of vignettes that linger in my memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the cloth market, women from different faiths gather daily, united in
      their negotiations against high prices. It’s an ordinary scene, yet
      there’s something reassuring in the shared rhythm.

      A few lanes away, at the Pochamma Temple, I witnessed a more imaginative
      way of coexistence. It was Vijayadashami in October 2023. A woman was
      cleaning the temple, authoritatively directing her brother as he arranged
      flowers. I left my chappals at a flower stall run by a burqa-clad woman
      before stepping inside. The woman at the temple noticed me, paused her
      work, and reached out to resume her priestly duties. She applied kumkum on
      my forehead as I prayed, then handed me prasad. I hesitated instinctively
      -- perhaps out of an unexamined concern for its quality. She read my
      discomfort, and suggested I give it to the flower seller outside instead.
      There was a natural grace to this moment, a quiet understanding, a sense
      of gentle pragmatism.

    <div>
      <p>
        Along the Harbour line, against the backdrop of Sewri’s oil tanks and
        Wadala’s slums, an ornate structure often caught my eye. Standing
        absurdly among weathered factories, its artsy onion dome felt
        wonderfully out of place. Google Maps named it Kusumbala Fountain, and
        further search led me to a detailed

          >writeup</a
        >
        by Ms. Sudha Ganapathi.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sudha narrated a poignant tale: Kusumbala, daughter of Lowji Megji,
        would offer water to exhausted workers unloading cotton bales at the
        nearby exchange. When she died young from a lingering illness, her
        father built this fountain in her memory as a lasting tribute to her
        kindness.

      In my opinion, Harbour Line offers the most thrilling route to travel in,
      both visually (Thane Creek!) and topographically (climbing, diving
      ramps!).

      A touching story - except it was entirely invented! Sudha’s sole source
      was a simple inscription: “The Public Gift Of Mr. Lowji Megji In Loving
      Memory Of His Late Daughter Kusumbala AD 1924”. Finding no other
      historical records, she spun this tale with a beautiful vision, gently
      disclosing her mischief towards the end. The story now lives on through
      reviews on Tripadvisor and Google Maps, each retelling further cementing
      this imagined history.

      >
      parts of it much later. To me, it’s deeply encouraging to see a narrative
      borne out of care brush against reality. There were alternate ways to
      interpret this fountain, but Sudha’s conscious choice to craft a story
      with heart brought her remarkably close to truth.

      Will I ever uncover Mangli Kanduri’s true origins? Maybe I haven’t talked
      to the right folks yet. I wonder if it’s even worth pursuing seeing the
      reluctance of different communities. Perhaps it doesn’t matter if I never
      find the definitive answer. It’s about the stories we choose to tell each
      other, the way we keep them alive in our memory. Following the thoughtful
      footsteps of Sudha and countless documenters of the city, I hope to
      approach these unknown artifacts with a warm, progressive lens. Sometimes,
      it seems, the stories we most lovingly imagine become basins of truth,
      attracting fragments of reality and affirming what we hoped was there all
      along.
    </p>
    <aside>
      It’s a bit like Gödel’s incompleteness theorem: beautiful truths await our
      discovery and interpretation, yet stubbornly remain beyond formal proof.

      on Byculla and his Instagram posts have been a significant inspiration for
      this essay. Pooja Ashokkumar’s (@thoughtsofmadrasi) work in Dharavi,
      destigmatizing and reframing it beyond its label as a slum while exploring
      Tamil heritage, has been particularly inspiring. Heritage walks by
      INTACH’s Mumbai Chapter and Khaki Tours have enriched my understanding of
      the city’s layered histories. Khaki Lab’s YouTube lecture series has been
      another excellent resource. I’m particularly fond of Khaki’s Vinayak
      Talwar (@vinampster) and his Instagram stories.
