  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>The paper<d-cite key="palackal2011mobile"></d-cite> stresses the need to undertake longitudinal
    studies to analyze the social impact of technology. Palackal
    et al. propose one such study to analyze the effect of
    widespread adoption of mobile phones on core networks.
    While some argue that mobile connectivity enriches
    our social bonds by keeping us in touch with our networks
    anytime-anywhere, others claim that mobiles only strengthen
    the primary ties, producing a <u>bounded solidarity</u> <d-cite key="ling2008new"></d-cite>.
    Due to increased participation in strong ties, we are shielded
    from indulging in weak ties, thereby leading to social
    insulation and network closure. Geser calls mobiles
    <em>antirevolutionary</em>, saying that modern era demands a
    dependence on various weak ties, and regressing to narrow
    <em>pre-modern</em> relations is bad <d-cite key="geser2006cell"></d-cite>. Palackal et al. conduct a
    longitudinal study and show that there is a significant
    positive correlation between adoption of mobiles and
    shrinkage of core networks. They also show that the core
    networks eventually get centered around friends and family
    in the same locale, thereby verifying bounded solidarity
    thesis.</p>
    <aside>Ling finds that through the use of various social rituals the mobile telephone strengthens social ties within the circle of friends and family—sometimes at the expense of interaction with those who are physically present—and creates what he calls <u>bounded solidarity</u></aside>
<p>Interviews of people from both professional and informal
  sectors of Kerala were conducted in 2002 and 2007. Given
  that Kerala had the highest proportion of mobile usage in
  India, we could ignore the limitations of microsociological
  effects. Another appealing aspect of Kerala is the already
  existing strong connectivity, owing to a large number of
  Malayalis who work in the Middle East. This enables
  us to look at mobiles as devices that add a layer of
  mobility, instead of the traditional view that mobiles
  provide connectivity in developing countries. The interview
  questionnaire asked for the location of core nets, mode
  and frequency of interaction among other things. The
  advantage of enquiring about core nets is that they would
  mostly remain the same across time, and would lead to
  unambiguous answers. It was observed that the size of core
  nets decreased over time and the proportion of friend/family
  nets increased over work nets. The authors attribute these
  observations to the positive network effects of mobile
  technology rather than social change (say, urbanization) as
  communication is central to strong ties and new modes of
  communication greatly affect these ties. The authors thus
  reify that periodic evaluation of technology is necessary to
  measure its social impact.</p>
  <h2>Analysis</h2>
  <h3>Technological Hearths</h3>
<p>Morley's 1986 study of family hearths <d-cite key="morley2005family"></d-cite> discussed how radio, TV, and
  computers brought families together at one place in their
  houses. From Palackal et al.’s findings, we can see that there is a continuity of how technology brings us together -
  mobiles are the new hearths, albeit in a more personalized
  manner. The various technologies we use to interact with
  our core networks turn into hearths eventually - whether it
  is a TV, mobile phone or a WhatsApp group. They do have
  an individualizing effect, but the fact that our local family
  ties are always close to us brings a sense of togetherness
  that a hearth offers. We looked at <u>media multiplexity
  theory</u> in Shriram Venkatraman’s book <d-cite key="venkatraman2017social"></d-cite>
  that suggests that
  we will always look to strengthen our strong ties, as we
  yearn for the warmth that they provide. People connected
  via stronger ties will use more media to communicate
  than those via weaker ties <d-cite key="haythornthwaite1998work"></d-cite>
  . The same
  is reinforced from the empirical research which shows
  that mobile usage has reached near saturation in Kerala,
  as the device provides not only connectivity but mobility too.</p>

<p>The warmth that these technological hearths provide
  has led to the formation of echo chambers, and there are 
  possible political manipulations too. We’ve seen how Cambridge Analytica easily
  mapped the characteristics of close friends of individuals
  based on the questions these individuals have answered.
  While they could achieve only approximate models of
  friends, their assumption that strong ties behave similarly
  turned out to be pretty accurate. There are models used by
  other tech companies that rely on the similarity between the
  members associated via strong ties - like Netflix predicting
  a similar set of movies to both the husband account and the wife
  account. Palackal et al.’s work clear up that this is not just
  solely the power of algorithms that crunch the data, but also
  the technology itself that encourages strong ties. Various
  recommender systems rely on the similarity of strong
  ties and the fact that technology keeps them in constant
  communication ensures that these similarities won’t change
  drastically over time, making it easier to model ( think feedback loops ).</p>
  <h3>The Medium is the Message</h3>
  <p>
    Marshall McLuhan said that technology
itself shapes and controls the scale and form of human
association <d-cite key="mcluhan1967medium"></d-cite>. He also said that while we take a myopic view
and process the messages, the medium brings in subtle
changes to the society. In a way, he implied <u>technological
determinism</u> - as in, technologies determine the social
fabric of society. While we know that this is not entirely
true, and there are various aspects of social shaping of technology to consider, the research by Palackal et al. shows
that technology is indeed changing the social structure by
reducing an individual’s core network size. However, it
is important to note that the structure has not changed to
a modern never-seen-before entity. There is a continuity
of pre-modern relations <d-cite key="geser2006cell"></d-cite> as mentioned in
the paper. </p>
<p>So essentially, we are reverting to a previous
structure. We’ve seen in Davis and Chouinard’s Affordance
Theory <d-cite key="davis2016theorizing"></d-cite> that an essential condition for affordance is the
structural embeddedness of a user. As the data suggests,
people are getting increasingly involved in only narrow
strong ties - leading to them being further embedded in the
same structure. This means that affordances that demand
an alternate set of structural norms will not seep in quickly.
Perhaps this is the reason why strong core networks are
prevalent even today - the new devices demanding an
alternate structure are unable to break into the closely knit
strong structures.

  <h3>Re-thinking Community in the Digital Age?</h3>
  <p>
    Let us take a look at Karen Evans' 2013 excerpt <d-cite key="evans2013re"></d-cite>, wherein she
argues that technology has only enhanced the pre-existing
relations and has not led to any significant change in
community structures. Social networks only provide means
to continue our offline interactions online and only those
who have good offline connections are connected online. She
also reported that connections are getting more local. These
views are in accordance with what we’ve discussed above
- the structures are getting stagnated, and it is becoming
increasingly difficult to seep into them. The empirical results
provided by this paper thus help us look deeper into the
sociological concepts of social structures and continuity of
technology in a much broader sense.
  </p>
  <h2>Concluding Remarks</h2>
  <p>
    The trends of bounded solidarity are observed on social
media too. I mostly interact only with my wingmates on
a Messenger group, instead of interacting with a wider
audience via Facebook. My <em>offline</em> interactions include
talking to wingmates in their rooms, corridors or canteens,
and it turns out my <em>online</em> interactions are dominated by
chatting with wingmates too. The chat group somewhat
transfers me to my wing, even if I am at some other location,
thereby drying up any potential to form weak ties with
people in the present location. When I started a Twitter
account, I shared my thoughts via tweets with a wide
audience, but eventually, I interacted more with a particular
group of anonymous people. We exchanged numbers and
created a WhatsApp group. From then on, my activity on
Twitter greatly reduced, and what could’ve been potential
tweets landed as texts on the group. There is a tendency to
move towards platforms where strong ties are encouraged,
as we value and cherish our strong ties more than the weak
ones (offline or online). On the whole, we are catering to a
nanoaudience instead of a global audience.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are some perils of interacting only with strong
ties. People find it difficult to participate in small talks
with strangers and handle the gaucherie involved. It leads
to the formation of echo chambers, leaving no scope for
introspection. Inappropriate behavior is normalized, and
you won’t be questioned on the same . It is easy to develop 
information cascades and with strong network effects at
play, we become extremely vulnerable to external agents that
try to control our choices. Governments are trying to curb
data flow to tech companies to ensure that such manipulation
of users is ceased. While it is a laudable move, the findings
of Palackal et al. show that mobile technologies themselves
promote strong ties, which in turn act as precursors to echo
chambers. If not by mining data, there could be other ways
to manipulate users given they are stuck in such narrow ties.
Maybe the paper provides a pointer to escape echo chambers
- let’s create technology to encourage more non-local and
weak ties.
