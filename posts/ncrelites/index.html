<d-article>
  <p>
    The paper <d-cite key="searle2013constructing"></d-cite> explores the question of how certain urban
landspaces are produced - is it real estate responding to
people’s desires or does real estate actually shape people’s
desires. The author analyzes this question by carrying out an
ethnographic study in Gurgaon (2007) and studying various
communication channels that the real estate developers
opted to convey information to prospective customers. The
author argues that the real estate developers relied on metadiscursive notions and essentially created a new class of
citizens called the professionals as opposed to the so-called
businessmen or the local Delhi people. This new class
ensured profitability and indexed demand for developers’
assets. She traces out a timeline of real estate’s journey in
Gurgaon region from the early 1990s to mid 2000s and
unravels the construction of meta-discursive notions.
  </p>
  <h2>Methodology</h2>
<p>
  The study was largely ethnographic with various interviews being conducted in 2007 with real estate developers,
  marketers, investors, brokers, informants etc. Searle also
  analyzed magazine articles ( such as <a href="http://realtyplusmag.com/" target="_blank">RealtyPlus</a> ), advertisements, investor presentations, apartment tours, and government census data. Thus, she exhaustively looked at all
  communication channels that the real estate developers opted
  for marketing purposes. She points out that some of her informants (upper-class) were biased, as in, they were more tilted
  towards supporting the upper class sentiments as opposed to
  the sentiments of the local Delhites.</p>
  
  <h2>The 90s Growth</h2>
  <h3>Liberalization</h3>
<p>
  The growth in Gurgaon started with liberalization in early
1990s. With lots of MNCs coming in, the demand for office
spaces grew. The government couldn’t build infrastructure at
the required pace - so they allowed for private investment
in urban spaces. To favour this, the Urban Act of 1976
was rolled back, which restricted the amount of land
private investors could hold. The JNNURM urban reforms
also favoured the developers and spun a chain of private
investments. The role of real estate developers before was
only to supply building material but now they became central
to people and market relations. Public banks hardly provided
formal funding to developers in the early 90s - but this
changed towards the late 90s. Despite the change in laws, the
developers realized that the funding is difficult and turned to
foreign investment.
</p>
<h3>Wooing foreign investors and NRIs</h3>
<p>
 Hence, target of real estate developers now was to
attract foreign investment and NRIs. The developers struck
joint partnerships with foreign investment banks to build 
individual projects like tech parks, townships. Some also
went public - like getting listed in Bombay Stock Exchange
or London Stock exchange. This made investment easier for
foreign companies. Additionally, to woo NRIs, developers
ran lots of advertisements with words like world class,
international standard, security system – to show that our
housing is on par with the housing in West.
</p>
<h3>Growth Stagnation</h3>
<p>
  However, the growth got stagnated. Investors just bought
and held the land for sometime - in hope of selling it
when the prices go up. The Asian Financial Crisis of 1997
forced NRIs to pull out of the market. Much of the land
remained vacant - with no real estate activities. Developers
realized that solving the issue of stagnation required dual
addressivity - they should first ensure market growth with
Indian consumers, and then attract foreign investors using
these Indian consumers. </p>

<p>How did they do that? They created
the figure of a genuine resident, ie, the <b>Professional</b>.
</p>

<h2>Businessmen vs Professionals</h2>
<p>
  Real estate developers essentially created a new class of
citizens called the professionals as opposed to the so-called
businessmen or the local Delhi people. The differences
broadly boil down to a Gemeinschaft vs Gesellschaft
scenario – so the businessmen could be characterized by
their traditional beliefs, they are rude, cheap, have large
families, non-elite, and apparently also indulge in shady
black money deals. Whereas the professionals are more into
the white collar jobs. They travel a lot, English speaking,
small families, DINK - which means the couple is dual
income no kid, and they are semi-posh.
</p>
<h2>Guaranteeing Demand</h2>
<p>
  We see in marketing discourse that foreign companies are
attracted to India by projecting the middle class as their
customers, because middle class has aspirations to improve
their living standards. However, the same can’t be used for
real estate investors because there is a belief that middle class
doesn’t spend much. Professionals, on the other hand, do
spend a lot as per their comfort.
</p>
<p>
  Developers advertised trends predicted by NCAER, Ernst
and Young. Trends of increasing nuclearization meant that
adults are breaking free from their families and there is a
need for new housing. The number of households in all
income brackets was increasing according to data, which
meant people are prone to save and invest in real estate. This
attracted investors and made them feel that investing in India
is safe. This also put Gurgaon in the global circuit of capital
flow.
</p>

<p>
  A major problem that developers faced was the cultural
issues that Indian consumers had. Firstly, they preferred
Delhi over Gurgaon. To solve this issue, developers
positioned Gurgaon as everything that is not Delhi, as in,
no traffic, no dust, no congestion, no pollution etc. Gurgaron
also had malls, multiplexes, top MNCs. Also, it is not that far
away from major areas of Delhi.</p>
<p>
Secondly, Indians preferred buying land and building their
own house, instead of buying an already built house. To solve
this issue, developers stopped advertising to people with
such traditional thought process. They attracted the nuclear,
modern generation; and sold a western living with words like
- Exotica, County, Laburnum.

<h2>Distinction and Exclusion</h2>
  <p>
    The author stresses on how real estate developers not only
    distanced Gurgaon in terms of aesthetics and infrastructure,
    but also in terms of society and class. <u>Bourgeois
    Environmentalism</u>, coined by Amita Baviskar, refers to how
    upper-class voices its need for aesthetics via proxies like
    concern for nature. In the context of Gurgaon, it refers
    to upper-class wanting class-exclusive environments which
    are free of social pollution. For instance, in an image of
    an advertisement shown in the paper, while Uniworld City
    advertise a pollution-free Gurgaon as opposed to polluted
    Delhi, the ad doesn’t show the polluted land of Delhi or
    the lush green Gurgaon. Instead it shows rikshaw walas,
    shopkeepers etc. The image clearly talks of social pollution. </p>

    </figure>
    <p>
    Advertisements also talk of how the complexes in Gurgaon
    are closer to the offices; plumbers and electricians etc. are
    available wtihin the complex; thus promoting integrated
    lifestyle communities with social homogeneity. Various
    other amenities such as 100% power back-up,
    guaranteed water and piped cooking gas are advertised
    extensively. By showing these amenities, the developers
    convey to us that there is no need to go outside the apartment
    complexes, that is, no chance of <u>class contamination</u>. In this
    way, the developers essentially sold a way-of-living to the
    professional class.
  </p>
  

  <h2>Case Study - Meet the Sharmas</h2>
  <p>
    The author studies an ad of "Sharmas" in a famous
newspaper - which contains real-world buyer profiles to let
the customers know exactly what type of people invest in
real estate. In this case, Rakesh Sharma works as a resident
manager of an MNC and Ankita Sharma is an exporter. The
story of Sharmas talks of how they are greatly favored by the
convenience that Gurgaon offers such as malls, multiplexes,
and office spaces in vicinity. Newspaper advertisements also
contain excerpts of how people like Sharmas earn profits by
investing in real estate. Articles with titles such as - "Small is
big - reaping rich rewards with small investments" encourage
various nuclear families to invest. Real estate magazines
also offer legal and financial advice in easy-to-understand
language; for example: mortgage lending, applying for loan.
This not only built trust between consumers and real estate
developers, but also <u>indexed demand</u>. The ads need not
be true or represent any social trend. However, people
get convinced and fall into the spiral, and this not only 
guarantees demand but also leads to an appreciation in prices
of houses.
  </p>

  <h2>Case Study - Meet the Sinhas</h2>
  <p>
    This case study discusses the influence of apartment tours
as a major player in building discursive notions. Apartment
tours reinforce the professional status of potential buyers.
The Sinhas are constantly reminded of their status. They
were told how similar they are to other neighbours living in
the apartment - this also shows that the apartment will retain
its class or valuation in case the Sinhas want to sell later. The
author feels that reminding of the class of a location helps in
indexing demand.
  </p>

  <h2>Critique of Paper</h2>
  <h3>Links to Socio-Spatial Theory</h3>
  <p>
    We’ve seen how the land of Gurgaon acquired value via the
marketing of real estate developers, which aligns well with
what Henry Lefebvre said - "Unlike farm land, urban land
acquires value by the collective societal effect". Lefebvre,
one of the primary members of the school of socio-spatial
theory, talked of how cities across the world appear to
develop and shape in a similar way, owing largely to real
estate developers and their desires. This is seen for the
case of Gurgaon too. Note that government’s involvement
and foreign investments are some primary components of
socio-spatial theory. Indian Government played a role in the
development of Gurgaon by allowing private investment in
urban spaces. The author also stresses on how international
ties, that is, investment from foreign companies and NRIs,
impacted the growth of Gurgaon. It is particularly seen in
how the developers framed the city and consumers to attract
them. We can connect this to the global view of urban
sociology, as proposed by David Harvey.

  <h3>Relevance of Study</h3>
  <figure>
    <img src="wework.png" border="1" style="width: 100%;">
    <figcaption>Fancy cups in a WeWork workplace </em></figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>Exploring how such metadiscursive notions are constructed
is important - for example, take the case of a tech startup
called WeWork, which can be thought of as a mediator
between customers and house owners. The reason for its
success is how well it sells the millenial story - and how
well it taps into the independent freelance worker class. The
workspaces contain fancy cups with "Always do what you
love" written. The pantry has beer, there are yoga rooms,
and weird looking chairs. WeWork also offers a classroom
program and the <a href="https://wegrow.com/schools" target="_blank">website</a> claims - "A field of super-elliptic
objects forms a learning landscape thats dense and rational,
yet free and fluid". While this
way of marketing sounds weird, the growth of WeWork
shows that such discourse works. The paper sheds light on
how such discourse develops and attracts customers.</p>
<aside>Here is an interesting analysis by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwAyUV6hTf8" target="_blank">PolyMatter</a> on WeWork's rise (and correct prediction of its fall)</aside>
