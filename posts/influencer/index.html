    We have witnessed a significant shift to the service sector in the Post-Fordist
economy. Maybe some of these services were offered in Industrial or Barter economy too, but not
monetized. One such service is that of social media influencers. We’ve had such influencers in the
past/offline - barbers telling us about a new shampoo, discussions on politics with auto-wallah.
People have been influencing the choices we make, whether we like it or not. Today, influencers
target the social media space. Let’s explore how this service fits into Post-Fordist conditions.
  </p>
  <aside>
    Google defines <u>Post-Fordism</u> as the theory that modern industrial production should change from the large-scale mass-production methods pioneered by Henry Ford towards the use of small flexible manufacturing units.</aside>
<p>
  <span class="types">Decentralized</span>. Influencers are just regular people with a mundane life. They could be
working for more than one company, which could be from any part of the world. They are not aware
of the inner proceedings of the company - they just have contact with the PR department. This shows
the globalized nature of such jobs. It is also evident that this job is at the periphery of the company
and very unstable. Hence, influencers tend to have other sources of income.
</p>
<p>
  <span class="types">Variety</span>. You can either post a text or a visual, or simply send a personal message to
users. The job is very flexible. The pay depends on the number of followers you have or other metrics
of influence (say, clout score). A person with 1 lakh followers might demand Rs.5000 per tweet, while
a meager Rs.100 would fetch you bulk tweets from 500 odd follower accounts. The job can either be
to endorse something (product, politician, agenda), or it can be to hurl bulk abuses at other users.
There is just so much variability in the job - the essence of the Post-Fordist economy.
</p>
<p>
  <span class="types">Surveillance</span>. The PR team of a company keeps a check on your activity, and whether
you have met the deadlines. It is very easy to catch a mistake - you’ll be penalized if the tweet count is not met, or
if the tweets did not receive enough engagement. Statistics of how the
influencer has worked are easily available and can be used to recruit better people or improve current
engagement levels.
</p>
<p>
  <span class="types">Quality Circles</span>. We often get influenced when we see someone getting influenced.
This can be understood via the cascading behavior of humans. To leverage this, companies have started
to promote conservations between influencers in social media space, wherein one of them pretends to
get influenced by the other. A set of influencers assigned to a particular agenda would form a quality
circle, thereby ensuring various hashtags are equally propelled forward.
</p>
<p>
  Thus, social media is not just about likes, shares, and comments. You can make
money too - all you need is a keyboard and some (dim)wit!
