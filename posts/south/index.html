  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>
    Shriram Venkatraman’s compelling book is a narrative
description of a 15-month long ethnographic study of social
media in a peri-urban area called <b>Panchagrami</b>, located
near Chennai in Tamil Nadu. The book is a product of
his research as part of a massive project called "Why We
Post - The Anthropology of Social Media" <d-cite key = "miller2016world"></d-cite>, dedicated
to understanding the impact of social media in various
field sites spanning from Brazil to China. This nonjudgemental book sticks to its intention of not evaluating
social media and provides detailed evidence of different use
cases of social media and its local consequences. Based
on his participatory observation and statistical analysis,
Venkatraman convincingly argues that social media in Tamil
Nadu has become a reflection of Tamil sensibilities and
structures. The peculiarities that the location offered did
not matter, as the various social categories just reasserted
themselves online.
  </p>
<p>Venkatraman’s choice of location is laudable. With the
  radical juxtaposition of modern IT workers and long-term
  villagers in one place, Panchagrami is a microcosm of
  modern India as an emerging and knowledge economy.
  Chapter 1 establishes the class, caste, age, gender and
  political complexities of Panchagrami. The next chapter
  traces the history of media usage in Panchagrami, with a
  particular focus on social media.</p>
<p>Chapter 3 explains another valid finding of the increased
  usage of visuals instead of text on social media. This chapter
  offers a granular assessment of the visuals posted by users
  by dividing the users based on class and caste, and further
  dividing the visuals as public, private and in-betweeners.
  By intertwining the study of offline visuals with online
  visuals, and exploring the history of visuals in Tamil Nadu,
  Venkatraman presents a strong idea of continuity of the
  offline world to the online world.</p>
<p>
  The overarching theme of Chapter 4 is intergenerational,
filial and siblings’ communication using social media. A
significant take-home point is that families intelligently use
social media to gain respect and maintain honour. Crucially,
this points out a limitation of social media - families don’t
use online social media (read Facebook) to express love
among themselves. Instead, they use Whatsapp which is
perceived as an offline service.
</p>
  <p>
    Chapter 5 deals with the IT work culture in Panchagrami,
and how social media is undermining the boundary between
work and non-work. Darshan and Naga’s example (p. 161)
of using social media to proactively recruit members of
their caste and the analysis on whether it has to be seen as a
sign of nepotism or social mobility is illuminating. Finally,
Chapter 6 focuses on how schools, teachers, and students
perceive social media. Less affluent schools see social media
as a symbol of social mobility whereas the wealthier schools
see it as a distraction.
  </p>
  <h2>Analysis</h2>
  <h3>Strengths</h3>
  <p>
    Venkatraman shines in conveying what makes this
site unique. He makes a sharp observation that offline
inequalities are not washed away by social media; instead,
social media only creates equality of presence online.
Communication occurs within socioeconomic groups and
not between them, and as the gap between the two groups
increases, communication becomes more functional than
social. He backs his claims with sufficient research and
evidence. Notably, as the chapters on visual communication,
work cultures, and education show, there is no difference in
the impact of social media on these socioeconomic groups.
Members of all groups post about cinema, politics, pictures
of Gods, and overtly display affection for their families
online. They all share commonalities and are influenced by
the Tamil ideals of culture and kinship.
  </p>
  <p>
    The book is written in an accessible and open style. The
fact that the author has lived, worked and interacted with
the people in local language, and the added benefit of him
being a professional statistician, reassures the readers of
the authenticity of the information provided in the book.
The book is free of comparisons and judgments and is
empirically strong in presenting a clear and concise picture
of social media usage in Panchagrami. Through social
media, Venkatraman takes the readers through a wide
spectrum of issues like gender, caste, class, education, work,
etc. which show how deeply intertwined and influential
social media is on the Tamil society. He smartly avoids
religious differences accounting for the fact that there are
conversions and caste divisions that cut through religions in
Panchagrami.
  </p>
  <p>
    Venkatraman seamlessly introduces complicated terms
like social scalability, polymedia, and media multiplexity
only after illustrating each with an exhaustive set of
examples. Some stories are very heart-warming, for
example, Ranjith and Sreelatha’s story (p. 124) which
deals with how Ranjith realizes the value of his sister
Sreelatha. The choice of exploring IT work cultures deserves
appreciation. IT sector seems to be the target of today’s
youth. Young readers who aspire to join the IT industry will
find the stories of Panchagrami’s IT workers eye-opening.
With focussed analysis on social media usage by students
and teachers alike, Venkatraman helps the readers peep into
the future of education in Tamil Nadu.
  </p>
  <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
  <p>
    To be sure, there are some weaknesses in the book.
The absence of religion-based political groups shows
the uniqueness of Panchagrami (p. 22). However, this
might disappoint readers who want a perspective on
India’s religion-based politics. Some points in the book
are repeated at multiple places. Venkatraman takes the
example of a 65-year-old middle-class man in Chapter 2
and his preference for voice communication over social
media indicating a hierarchy in communication. The same
example is repeated in Chapter 4, in greater detail. Similarly,
surveillance of female social media users is repeated in both
Chapter 2 and Chapter 4. Indeed, taking these examples at
multiple places ensures completeness of the chapters. But
the repetition of the same ideas is both redundant and jarring.
  </p>
  <p>
    Given the scale of research, it is challenging to explore
all areas of social media. The field is rapidly changing,
with new technology emerging almost daily. Nevertheless,
there are some notable areas which deserved analysis. It
is surprising that the author has not included a review of
Facebook Messenger, which has been mentioned in the book
only once (p. 124). A few lines about why WhatsApp is
considered more private than Messenger would’ve provided
a complete picture of the assumed affordances of these
social media services. Sri Lakshmi and Karuppiah’s story
(p. 118) offered a fascinating insight into the use of emojis
by lower socio-economic groups. This emoji use should’ve
been analyzed further given the rising prominence of visual
symbols over text. </p>
<p>
The comparative book <d-cite key = "miller2016world"></d-cite> of "Why We
Post" series has a small account of Venkatraman explaining
the E-commerce scene in Panchagrami (p. 96), and why
men from lower socio-economic classes prefer online
purchases. E-commerce usage should’ve been addressed in
the present book too. While student usage of social media
was explored in great detail in Chapter 6, it lacked the
mention of addiction to pornography.
  </p>
  <p>
    Venkatraman did touch upon actors’ fan clubs and memes
in Chapter 3, but only superficially. <a href="https://swarajyamag.com/politics/how-memes-and-whatsapp-forwards-are-nudging-tamil-youth-into-violent-activism" target="_blank">Memes</a> 
, <a href="https://scroll.in/reel/829643/fan-clubs-or-fight-clubs-the-online-rivalry-between-ajith-and-vijay-is-taking-new-shape" target="_blank">fan wars</a> 
and
anonymous trolling are on the rise in Tamil Nadu. It seems
as if teenagers communicate exclusively through Tamil
memes and film dialogue references. Fan wars involve teens
fighting in YouTube comment sections and hurling abuses
against each other. Posting morphed images and videos of
their rival actors has become a norm in these fan pages.
Things are getting uglier with this troll culture seeping into
the regime of Tamil politics. Hence, Tamil Nadu’s troll
culture warranted a stronger analysis in the book.
  </p>
  <p>
    To reiterate, we must acknowledge that some topics are
bound to be missed out given the enormity of conducting
ethnographic research. Venkatraman has done a fantastic job
in stacking the book with rich content, and it leaves the
readers with many ideas to ponder over. The book is a must-read for anyone who wants to get a clear picture of social
media in Tamil Nadu.
