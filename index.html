                    I am a Software Engineer at the non-profit <a href="https://www.avantifellows.org/"><u>Avanti Fellows</u></a>, where I develop open source technology for public school systems alongside <a href="https://substack.com/@pritamps"><u>Pritam Sukumar</u></a>. I also mentor contributors in the <a href="https://codeforgovtech.in/"><u>Code for GovTech</u></a> program, supporting the creation of Digital Public Goods. I deeply aspire to understand how machine learning can help us address critical needs within public systems and to build responsible technology. Previously, I worked as a Research Associate at <a href="https://research.adobe.com/careers/bangalore/"><u>Adobe Research</u></a> under the guidance of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/balajivasan/?originalSubdomain=in"><u>Balaji Vasan Srinivasan</u></a>. Before Adobe, I studied Electrical Engineering and Machine Learning at IIT Kanpur, where my thesis advisor was <a href="https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/piyush/"><u>Prof. Piyush Rai</u></a>. Feel free to reach out to me at: <a  href="mailto:teja.surya59@gmail.com" style="font-family: Courier; font-size: 16px">teja.surya59@gmail.com</a> <br>
              <blockquote style=" margin-top: 8px; margin-bottom: 12px; padding: 10px; background-color: rgba(179, 131, 55, 0.2);">
                I recently shared detailed notes on my research taste. Do check <a href="posts/taste"><u>this post</u></a> and let me know if any of the ideas resonate with you.
              </blockquote>
              To emphasize, I have a strong interest in designing models with the following characteristics:
              <ul>
                <li>1) formulated and deployed with care for local communities,</li>
                <li>2) built with domain-dependent inductive biases,</li>
                <li>3) small scale; both in parameter count and training data size,</li>
                <li>4) adequately specified while graciously leaving room for critique,</li>
                <li>5) controllable and interpretable; likely through discrete latent variables,</li>
                <li>6) inferred via (semi)differentiable approximate Bayesian procedures.</li>
              </ul>
              That's a lot! Briefly, I'd like to go against the tide of current ML trends and build adequately-sized models with an unwavering commitment to responsible practices.<br><br>
              Outside of work, I enjoy movies and books, not only for the art but also for dissecting the craft. You can check out my Goodreads reviews <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25851872-surya-bulusu"><u>here</u></a>. I plan to write more on other books soon.  As for movies, I keep my hot takes offline but am happy to share them if you're interested.
              <br><br>I am also keen on exploring cities and their hidden spaces. Based in Mumbai, I'm endlessly intrigued by its urban histories and politics. If I'm not at home, you might find me loitering in the gullies around Sion or Byculla.

                        PMI forms the foundation of my understanding in ML, anchoring my intuitions and expanding my approach to complex problems. My fascination with PMI began with the CS698X course at IIT Kanpur, taught by Prof. Piyush Rai, which was a pivotal experience. I've exhaustively documented my thoughts on PMI <a href="posts/taste/index.html#probabilistic-modelling-and-inference-(pmi)"><u>here</u></a>.

We focused on two key ideas: the power of bandits in sequential interaction, facilitating online learning, and the efficiency of clustering arms to streamline computations. Using a DP-means approach with stick-breaking priors, we bypassed the need for a fixed cluster size, letting clusters emerge naturally. <a href="assets/bandit_clustering.pdf"><u>Report</u></a> | <a href="https://github.com/shngt/bayesian-bandit-clustering"><u>Code</u></a></li>
                            <li>(b) <b>Mixture of ARMA</b>: This related project asks whether time series can be modeled as a mixture of ARMA processes, clustering them using the EM algorithm. <a href="assets/Mixture_of_ARMA.pdf"><u>Report</u></a> | <a href="https://github.com/suryabulusu/ARMA_mixtures/blob/master/Code_Report.ipynb"><u>Code</u></a></li>

This approach draws from the work of Ben Poole et al. and Yee Whye Teh on the Gumbel-Softmax trick.  Differentiating them is a pain, yet I'm thoroughly fascinated by VAEs and the interpretability offered via discrete LVs. <a href="https://github.com/suryabulusu/sslvae/"><u>Code</u></a></li>

                        Image and text generation tasks are highly pedagogical. They have been a great entry point for me into Deep Learning. However, I have <a href="posts/taste/index.html#image-based-tasks"><u>mixed thoughts</u></a> about the subfield in its current shape.

                        Generating images and videos certainly has its functional applications, but I feel it doesn't yet fully capture the needs of a creative's toolbox. What truly excites me is the prospect of co-creation. Just as a chat interface provides an interactive flow in textual modality, I envision a similarly iterative, back-and-forth process in image and video modalities. This interaction doesn't have to be limited to a human-agent dynamic; it could very well involve human-human interactions, with an agent in the background, subtly aligning differences.

                            <li>(a) <b>Codifying Conflicts in Co-Coloring</b>: We looked at the process of creatives collaborating on a simple line-art coloring task, focusing on the conflicts and pain points that arise. Through user studies, we explored whether participants could effectively collaborate and impart their unique preferences in the final artwork. This project allowed me to work with SVGs, a flexible and often overlooked modality.

                            <li>(b) <b>Collabcolor</b>: Extending the previous task, we developed CollabColor, an RL-based support system that assists users in finding a shared creative vision during collaboration. Framed as a multi-agent MDP, this project encompassed user studies, behaviour cloning, supervised RL with transformers, extensive evaluations, and more. We found that CollabColor's interventions improved coherence in final colorizations. While the immediate impact is on artistic collaboration, can RL interventions broadly help reconcile local differences toward societal harmony? Perhaps a utopian overreach, but one worth pursuing. <a href="assets/iui_collabcolor_draft.pdf"><u>Paper Draft</u></a></li>

                        My experience working on creative support systems highlighted a recurring issue: users struggle with large, slow models that aren't well-suited for production or mobile use. I've always felt that today's models are bloated, impacting UX unnecessarily. This led me to an interest in compression and efficiency.

                            <li>(a) <b>Post-OCR Error Detection</b>: OCR outputs suffer from common document issues like poor angles, folds, and creases. For Adobe Scan, I developed a lightweight, mobile-friendly model that flags documents likely to yield OCR errors, enabling targeted post-processing. <a href="https://github.com/suryabulusu/play-notebooks/blob/main/onnx_tut.ipynb"><u>Code</u></a></li>
                            <li>(b) <b>User-guided Variable-rate Learned Image Compression</b>: Neural nets can compress images but this process is lossy. I explored an approach where we ask users for their critical regions and compress less aggressively in those regions. This enables differential bit allocation, allowing a single model to operate at multiple bit rates.

                        Alongside ML research, I've been deeply interested in the sociological, historical, and political landscapes of the communities I belong to. My previous research often catered to functional productivity and efficiency, and I wanted to explore public interest technology that primarily serves human-centered values. Low-resource contexts require participatory action and field research with care and dignity as a necessary ethic. I feel these constraints, whether geographical or economic, can foster uniquely creative solutions.
