            I worked on generating coordinated image-text pairs at <strong>Adobe Research, Bengaluru</strong> in the summer of 2019. Our work has been accepted at IUI 2020. Preprint coming soon!<br><br>

                <b>Past Projects</b> : <br><br>
1. <b>Stock Market Prediction</b> : I participated in a Machine Learning Hackathon by Credit Suisse held in Jio Park, Mumbai, along with 2 of my friends Tushar Goswamy and Vatsalya Tandon. We were asked to predict the top 50 performing stocks of the next day using NSE stock market data. Since data was not provided, we had to write our own parser to collect data from Yahoo Finance. Despite receiving an accuracy of only 55% using LSTM model, we secured third-place for our excellent feature engineering.

	<br><br>	2. <b>Exoplanet Detection using Kepler Light Curve Data</b> : This was a problem in the Inter IIT Tech Meet 2017 
conducted in IIT Madras. I worked on this problem in the Winter Break of 2017. It involved classification of light curves into two classes: containing exoplanets, and not containing exoplanets.
This is an open ended research problem and the best result obtained so far can be found <a href="https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~avanderb/kepler90i.pdf">here</a>. Check out 
<a href="https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~avanderb/tutorial/tutorial.html">this</a> tutorial to understand the problem better. <br><br>
  3. <b>SongTrain</b> : I made a web app along with 2 of my friends Lakshay Bandlish and Raghav Aggarwal for a competition called code.fun.do by Microsoft. Initially I worked in developing the webpages and designed the flow of the
web app using Django. Later on I developed the database, wrote code for generating real time frequency graphs using RickshawJS and other back-end aspects like queuing and
hashing of songs. We were adjudged the winners of
National Finals of code.fun.do Showcase held in Microsoft Hyderabad. Check out the demo video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA8vgPW-Ju0">here</a>.
