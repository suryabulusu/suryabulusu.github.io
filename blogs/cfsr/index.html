<d-article>
  <p>Uber values economists a lot - their Ubernomics team is considered the
most valuable of all. Economists love working with Uber for the huge amounts of data it
provides, and also that they can apply their basic 101 theories and get actual results. This
is very much unlike the rest of the world, where 101s are usually vague approximations.
So, Uber gives the economists the data - and they conduct analysis of various things like
job satisfaction of drivers, user satisfaction, comparison with other industries etc. What
could possibly go wrong?</p>
<p>Company-funded research has been panned by many academicians for
cheating with data and producing results in favour of the company. There is also the
problem that companies are luring away well-respected academicians with money and
data. For example, Alan Kruger - a well respected economist - conducted studies on
Uber’s data. The study was overtly supportive of Uber - claiming that it increases
satisfaction levels of both drivers and customers. The paper was panned by many
academicians from prominent institutes like MIT, Stanford etc for wrong methodologies
applied.</p>
<p>It’s not just Uber. Facebook’s head of Artificial Intelligence Research is
Dr. Yann LeCun. LeCun is considered on of the most important personalities of the
machine learning community, and the MNIST dataset he released is used by all ML
aspiring students and researchers at some stage of their studies. He has come under
criticism for Facebook’s wrong practices. Is it fair to say that we are losing great
academicians to company-funded research field?</p>
<p>As a society, how much can we rely on their research now? If companies
like Google, Facebook, Amazon bag up all the top academicians - can we still accept
their research as honest and without any bias? It is important for governments to make
interventions in these things and penalize the companies if they produce fake research.
The issue is, maybe we all as a collective are not talented enough to catch the mistakes in
their research in the first place. We still have a long way to go to cope up with these tech
giants...</p>
